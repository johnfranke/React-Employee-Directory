# React Employee Directory

## Overview

This is an employee directory made with React.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## More Info

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user is able to

  * sort the directory by first name, last name, employee id, and job title.

  * filter by first name, last name, employee id, or job title by using the search feature.
